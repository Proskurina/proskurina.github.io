&lt;p&gt;It is a warm-up before our final projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the beginning of the week we had a brainstorming session on sharing various ideas of what could be done during the week. Some of the ideas were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a warm-up before our final projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the beginning of the week we had a brainstorming session on sharing various ideas of what could be done during the week. Some of the ideas were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to make a todolist that can be used by several people, with shared goals,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to write a twitter with messenger,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do something Halloween themed,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to make a plug-in for Chrome that will let you close opened windows/tabs by whistling,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to make an on-line game,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make it possible to open the entrance door from Slack,
and many-many others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved the idea about whistling, but I had no clue how to approach it and if it is even doable! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were two more guys who loved the idea and we formed an absolute dream team!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guess what? We did it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try it &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/whistle-stop/lhngddjdgdjkeccbdjfapfconjkhbaed?hl=en-GB"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Add it to Chrome, open a new window (not a tab, sorry still have a couple of bugs to catch), allow mic, open more tabs, browse in Internet and if someone enters the room... whistle! All tabs will be closed in a moment! Of course you were not procrastinating in Facebook!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Days 54-55</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Last Friday formal part of the course have finished.

&lt;p&gt;So I decided to make the list of books that helped me a lot during these 8 weeks. I am sure I will come back to these books many times after the course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Well-grounded Rubyist by David A. Black (pre-course) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practical object oriented design in Ruby aka POODR by great Sandi Metz (1st and 2nd weeks) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jump start Sinatra by Darren Jones (3rd and 4th weeks)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTML/CSS and JavaScript/jQuery by Jon Duckett (5th and 6th weeks) - good books, but too many pictures, and as a result no kindle version and too heavy to carry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ruby on rails tutorial  by Michael Hartl and The rails 4 way by Obie Fernandez, Kevin Faustino (7th week)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AngularJS Up &amp;amp; Running by Shyam Seshadri, Brad Green (8th week)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a good read!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Day 53</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Today Evgeniy (Makers founder and CEO) gave a great talk on Teal companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In this book the author uses a colour scheme to describe the historical development of human organizations: Red &gt; Orange &gt; Green &gt; Teal. &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Laloux lists three breakthroughs of Teal organizations:&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Self-management: driven by peer relationships&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Wholeness: involving the whole person at work&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Evolutionary purpose: let the organization adapt and grow, not be driven&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In simple words Teal companies are based on trust, responsible and proactive approach to work. No one tells you what to do and you do things only if you believe that these things are worth doing. And at work you are the same person as in "real" life, because work IS your real life and you do not have to pretend to be someone else. So the main idea is to work and enjoy life at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds like a dream! But it is real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that Makers Academy is fantastic not only for students but also for people who work there.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Day 52</title><description>&lt;p&gt;This is a short addition to my previous post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, you are deploying your app to heroku. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you do not want to push bower_components folder to github or heroku (so bower_components is in your .gitignore file).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to make heroku run &lt;code&gt;bower install&lt;/code&gt; and install bower_components&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://localhost:2368/day-52/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">e7804234-173f-460a-803d-702af1663fce</guid><dc:creator>Yana Proskurina</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 22 Oct 2015 19:41:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This is a short addition to my previous post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, you are deploying your app to heroku. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you do not want to push bower_components folder to github or heroku (so bower_components is in your .gitignore file).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to make heroku run &lt;code&gt;bower install&lt;/code&gt; and install bower_components to the right folder?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 simple steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Include bower as dependency into your &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; file like this:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  "dependencies": {
    "bower": "^1.6.3"
  }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will tell heroku to install bower in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) In the same &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; file tell heroku to run &lt;code&gt;bower install&lt;/code&gt;. You do it like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "bower install"
  },
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Indicate where you want bower_components to be installed. By default this folder will appear in your root directory, if you want it to be in another place you need &lt;code&gt;.bowerrc&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if you want it to be in &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt; folder you indicate it in your &lt;code&gt;.bowerrc&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  "directory" : "public/bower_components"
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now heroku knows what to do!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Day 51</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Now I have my little, but nice and working one page web-site built with Angular, but it is working only in my browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course I want to deploy it to heroku. But I need to build a server first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could do it with Sinatra, but it is JS&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://localhost:2368/day-51/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">10d4456c-6c94-4215-b7cf-0e93e319f655</guid><dc:creator>Yana Proskurina</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 21 Oct 2015 18:50:52 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Now I have my little, but nice and working one page web-site built with Angular, but it is working only in my browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course I want to deploy it to heroku. But I need to build a server first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could do it with Sinatra, but it is JS and Angular... So why not use NodeJS and Express. It seems more natural, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is easy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my app now is something like this:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;project  
|___.git(folder, lots of things going on here)
|___bower_components
|___node_modules
|
|___js
|   |__app.js
|   |__gitUserSearchController.js
|   |__searchFactory.js
|
|___test
|   |__gitSearchController.spec.js
|   |__karma.conf.js
|   |__searchFactory.spec.js
|
|___bower.json
|___index.html
|___package.json
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, install node and &lt;a href="http://expressjs.com/starter/installing.html"&gt;express&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then in a root directory make a little server, for example, &lt;code&gt;server.js&lt;/code&gt;, that looks something like this:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var express = require('express');  
var app = express();

app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/public'));

app.get('/', function (req, res) {  
  res.sendFile(__dirname + '/index.html');
});

app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000, function() {  
  console.log("listening on 3000");
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of it is just a simple example from &lt;a href="http://expressjs.com/starter/hello-world.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things I changed are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;made direct reference to my &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; file (yes, there in no need to render html here!),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;added &lt;code&gt;process.env.PORT&lt;/code&gt; (for Heroku). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also moved my &lt;code&gt;js&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;bower_components&lt;/code&gt; folders to &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt; folder (no need to even change pathes to files in &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; file! Though if you have secrets in js folder, don't forget to change path in &lt;code&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now do &lt;code&gt;node server.js&lt;/code&gt; and enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While deploying to heroku remember about &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dependencies to be listed (and installed) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;secrets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not deploying node_modules and bower_components. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Days 49-50</title><description>&lt;p&gt;This week is Angular week. Angular is very powerful, but is always a bit tricky in the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we have new coaches, they are very cool, but I will miss our old ones, they were geniuses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week we are going learn Ruby on rails. It is not that we really can learn it in a week, but as always we will give it a try and do our best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the only thing I can say about it is MAGIC! It knows everything. Do not try to do anything your way, Ruby on rails knows better! I think it is the centrepiece of our course. So, the week should be very interesting (as if we've ever had a not interesting one).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seemed ok in the beginning, code looked nice, then became heavier, then unreadable and then... I followed one of our coaches advice: "It is always fun to throw everything away and  start from the beginning". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had another idea on how to build it. The task became ok again, I wrote a nice engine, it all worked so nicely, that I decided to make an interface. That was not wise. I stopped sleeping at nights. I even came back to the first version of the code, but it made things even worse. I went to a long long walk to a park. And the next day again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then suddenly I had a solution. And it worked! And it involved only reasonable amount of code! And I even had some time to write this post!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the lesson was learned - if you need an interface, think about it from the beginning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New knowledge for the last 3 days in few words:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEAN stays for Mongo, Express, Angular and Node.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Node helps you to run&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://localhost:2368/days-35-37/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">843845c3-7da3-4def-b5aa-17483656b025</guid><dc:creator>Yana Proskurina</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 07 Oct 2015 19:19:21 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Well, obviously I do not follow my plan...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least I do not post here every day, but that is because I learn so many things simultaneously! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New knowledge for the last 3 days in few words:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEAN stays for Mongo, Express, Angular and Node.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Node helps you to run your JS program using terminal, just print &lt;code&gt;node &amp;lt;filename.js&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in command line. If you type &lt;code&gt;node&lt;/code&gt; in terminal you can play with JS the same way as you play with Ruby using &lt;code&gt;irb&lt;/code&gt; (but I already got used to console and console.log()). It is not a server, but you can create one with it. And everything is in JS! So no need to switch from JS to Ruby (or another language) and back. An important thing about Node is that it is asynchronous, which makes it very effective. But you have to use callbacks for that, and it is not so straight forward in the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Express is something like Sinatra, but for Node JS. It seems easier and more intuitive, but may be it is because we already learned how to deal with Sinatra. For express template engine is not needed, it can handle html files directly, it is good for simple projects but for more complicated you can use Jade or ejs (they are like erb for ruby).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mongo is a non SQL database, it stores information as JSON, and it seems a bit chaotic, but may be it is not, I just started to play with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Angular... I am not sure yet. We will have the whole week dedicated to it, so I will write about it later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.udemy.com/node-js-tutorial/#0"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is fantastic blog post on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Day 34</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Finally have time to think about lab week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lab week is a week when we are on our own. No fixed plan. Everyone does what he needs most: review of previous challenges, learn JS, explore new technologies or sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My plan is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My plan is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to finish JS by Jon Duckett (at least 50-60 pages per day),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to learn more about MEAN (todo project from scotch.io? rps in JS? smth else?),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to pair program at least 3 days of the week,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to attend standups with my byte every day,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to post about my progress every day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too ambitious? May be. We'll see.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Day 33</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Rugby day! &lt;br&gt;

Their final projects were amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the middle of the course (equator as they say in uni) for us, we are officially seniors now. Time to think what our final projects could be.&lt;/p&gt;
