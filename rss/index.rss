&lt;p&gt;Of course I want to deploy it to heroku. But I need to build a server first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could do it with Sinatra, but it is JS and Angular... So why not use NodeJS and Express. It seems more natural, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is easy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my app now is something like this:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;project  
|___.git(folder, lots of things going on here)
|___bower_components
|___node_modules
|
|___js
|   |__app.js
|   |__gitUserSearchController.js
|   |__searchFactory.js
|
|___test
|   |__gitSearchController.spec.js
|   |__karma.conf.js
|   |__searchFactory.spec.js
|
|___bower.json
|___index.html
|___package.json
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, install node and &lt;a href="http://expressjs.com/starter/installing.html"&gt;express&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then in a root directory make a little server, for example, &lt;code&gt;server.js&lt;/code&gt;, that looks something like this:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var express = require('express');  
var app = express();

app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/public'));

app.get('/', function (req, res) {  
  res.sendFile(__dirname + '/index.html');
});

app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000, function() {  
  console.log("listening on 3000");
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of it is just a simple example from &lt;a href="http://expressjs.com/starter/hello-world.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things I changed are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;made direct reference to my &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; file (yes, there in no need to render html here!),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;added &lt;code&gt;process.env.PORT&lt;/code&gt; (for Heroku). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also moved my &lt;code&gt;js&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;bower_components&lt;/code&gt; folders to &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt; folder (no need to even change pathes to files in &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; file! Though if you have secrets in js folder, don't forget to change path in &lt;code&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now do &lt;code&gt;node server.js&lt;/code&gt; and enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While deploying to heroku remember about &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dependencies to be listed (and installed) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;secrets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not deploying node_modules and bower_components. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Days 49-50</title><description>&lt;p&gt;This week is Angular week. Angular is very powerful, but is always a bit tricky in the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we have new coaches, they are very cool, but I will miss our old ones, they were geniuses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week we are going learn Ruby on rails. It is not that we really can learn it in a week, but as always we will give it a try and do our best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://rewalls.com/pic/201111/1024x600/reWalls.com-52370.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the only thing I can say about it is MAGIC! It knows everything. Do not try to do anything your way, Ruby on rails knows better! I think it is the centrepiece of our course. So, the week should be very interesting (as if we've ever had a not interesting one).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in the evening I went to Dee Dee Bridgewater concert! She was fantastic!  I must admit that the course intensity is tough but bearable, it is my social life intensity that is killing me.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Days 38-41: Strike!</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The end of the week and weekend I spent working mostly on our bowling challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seemed ok in the beginning, code looked nice, then became heavier, then unreadable and then... I followed one of our coaches advice: "It is always fun to throw everything away and  start from the beginning". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had another idea on how to build it. The task became ok again, I wrote a nice engine, it all worked so nicely, that I decided to make an interface. That was not wise. I stopped sleeping at nights. I even came back to the first version of the code, but it made things even worse. I went to a long long walk to a park. And the next day again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then suddenly I had a solution. And it worked! And it involved only reasonable amount of code! And I even had some time to write this post!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the lesson was learned - if you need an interface, think about it from the beginning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New knowledge for the last 3 days in few words:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEAN stays for Mongo, Express, Angular and Node.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least I do not post here every day, but that is because I learn so many things simultaneously! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New knowledge for the last 3 days in few words:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEAN stays for Mongo, Express, Angular and Node.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Node helps you to run your JS program using terminal, just print &lt;code&gt;node &amp;lt;filename.js&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in command line. If you type &lt;code&gt;node&lt;/code&gt; in terminal you can play with JS the same way as you play with Ruby using &lt;code&gt;irb&lt;/code&gt; (but I already got used to console and console.log()). It is not a server, but you can create one with it. And everything is in JS! So no need to switch from JS to Ruby (or another language) and back. An important thing about Node is that it is asynchronous, which makes it very effective. But you have to use callbacks for that, and it is not so straight forward in the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Express is something like Sinatra, but for Node JS. It seems easier and more intuitive, but may be it is because we already learned how to deal with Sinatra. For express template engine is not needed, it can handle html files directly, it is good for simple projects but for more complicated you can use Jade or ejs (they are like erb for ruby).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mongo is a non SQL database, it stores information as JSON, and it seems a bit chaotic, but may be it is not, I just started to play with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Angular... I am not sure yet. We will have the whole week dedicated to it, so I will write about it later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.udemy.com/node-js-tutorial/#0"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is fantastic blog post on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Day 34</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Finally have time to think about lab week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 2 pm I had to have a break as I had tickets to Dismaland and needed to catch 3pm train from Paddington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I continued in a train. And a couple of times I was so stuck that I was literally ready to cry. When you have an error and you have no clue how to deal with it! And so many files and folders so you cannot figure out which one could be failing...  And no internet connection... And you do not know where you are and at what station you need to change the train!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I finished it on my way back! And I have the whole Sunday for myself! For the first time since the course has started!&lt;/p&gt;
