&lt;p&gt;Now we have new coaches, they are very cool, but I will miss our old ones, they were geniuses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week we are going learn Ruby on rails. It is not that we really can learn it in a week, but as always we will give it a try and do our best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://rewalls.com/pic/201111/1024x600/reWalls.com-52370.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the only thing I can say about it is MAGIC! It knows everything. Do not try to do anything your way, Ruby on rails knows better! I think it is the centrepiece of our course. So, the week should be very interesting (as if we've ever had a not interesting one).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in the evening I went to Dee Dee Bridgewater concert! She was fantastic!  I must admit that the course intensity is tough but bearable, it is my social life intensity that is killing me.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Days 38-41: Strike!</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The end of the week and weekend I spent working mostly on our bowling challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seemed ok in the beginning, code looked nice, then became heavier, then unreadable and then... I followed one of our coaches advice: "It is always fun to throw everything away and  start from the beginning". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had another idea on how to build it. The task became ok again, I wrote a nice engine, it all worked so nicely, that I decided to make an interface. That was not wise. I stopped sleeping at nights. I even came back to the first version of the code, but it made things even worse. I went to a long long walk to a park. And the next day again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then suddenly I had a solution. And it worked! And it involved only reasonable amount of code! And I even had some time to write this post!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the lesson was learned - if you need an interface, think about it from the beginning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New knowledge for the last 3 days in few words:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEAN stays for Mongo, Express, Angular and Node.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Node helps you to run your JS program using terminal, just print &lt;code&gt;node &amp;lt;filename.js&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in command line. If you type &lt;code&gt;node&lt;/code&gt; in terminal you can play with JS the same way as you play with Ruby using &lt;code&gt;irb&lt;/code&gt; (but I already got used to console and console.log()). It is not a server, but you can create one with it. And everything is in JS! So no need to switch from JS to Ruby (or another language) and back. An important thing about Node is that it is asynchronous, which makes it very effective. But you have to use callbacks for that, and it is not so straight forward in the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Express is something like Sinatra, but for Node JS. It seems easier and more intuitive, but may be it is because we already learned how to deal with Sinatra. For express template engine is not needed, it can handle html files directly, it is good for simple projects but for more complicated you can use Jade or ejs (they are like erb for ruby).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mongo is a non SQL database, it stores information as JSON, and it seems a bit chaotic, but may be it is not, I just started to play with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Angular... I am not sure yet. We will have the whole week dedicated to it, so I will write about it later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.udemy.com/node-js-tutorial/#0"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is fantastic blog post on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Day 34</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Finally have time to think about lab week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it was the most difficult weekend challenge so far. I started on Saturday at 9 am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 2 pm I had to have a break as I had tickets to Dismaland and needed to catch 3pm train from Paddington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I continued in a train. And a couple of times I was so stuck that I was literally ready to cry. When you have an error and you have no clue how to deal with it! And so many files and folders so you cannot figure out which one could be failing...  And no internet connection... And you do not know where you are and at what station you need to change the train!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I finished it on my way back! And I have the whole Sunday for myself! For the first time since the course has started!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was not so bad after all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bugs that we make and catch during our learning process are not so epic of course, but sometimes an extra letter, a typo, lack of a dot or comma can easily ruin several hours of your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now I got a flue bug, had to stay at home and decided to write this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how to find a bug?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, as a beginner, the easiest way to catch a bug is to print out everything that's going on in my code. I put a print (&lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;puts&lt;/code&gt;) statement before and after every line of my code, with a short explanation of what I am printing. Then I literally can read when and where a bug appears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are better ways. For example, using &lt;code&gt;pry&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;byebug&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pry is very similar to irb, but has some extra features. &lt;br&gt;
To use pry, first you need to install it using &lt;code&gt;gem install pry&lt;/code&gt; or include &lt;code&gt;gem 'pry'&lt;/code&gt; to your &lt;code&gt;Gemfile&lt;/code&gt; and run &lt;code&gt;bundle install&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you need to &lt;code&gt;require pry&lt;/code&gt; in a file, where you want to find a bug, and print &lt;code&gt;binding.pry&lt;/code&gt; before the place where you think the bug can be. When you run your program, it will stop at &lt;code&gt;binding.pry&lt;/code&gt; point. And then you can print next lines in pry, receiving feedback on what is going on after each line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using byebug is similar. You install it using &lt;code&gt;gem install byebug&lt;/code&gt; or include it into your &lt;code&gt;Gemfile&lt;/code&gt; and run &lt;code&gt;bundle install&lt;/code&gt;. Then you &lt;code&gt;require byebug&lt;/code&gt; in a file anf print &lt;code&gt;byebug&lt;/code&gt; in your file where you want your program to stop running. And then you can play with byebug, the same way as you play with irb or pry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bugs have no chances!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most difficult thing in structure is to create all necessary files and to connect them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is how a structure of our simple project looks like now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most difficult thing in structure is to create all necessary files and to connect them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is how a structure of our simple project looks like now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;project  
|___.git(folder, lots of things going on here)
|___Gemfile
|___Gemfile.lock
|___app
|   |__app.rb
|   |__data_mapper_setup.rb

    |   |__third_feature_test_spec.spec
    |
    |___spec_helper.spec
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only three weeks of learning and I understand what each file is needed for! Well, I think I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;App folder is all about our app, spec folder is about tests (same as .rspec file), .git is a folder with version control files, Gemfiles are about gems and config is to start our program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connecting all these files is a separate story. We use &lt;code&gt;require&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;require_relative&lt;/code&gt; to connect files:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;app.rb (our controller file for now) requires data_mapper_setup.rb, data_mapper_setup.rb requires model files (and that's how app.rb also knows about model files);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in .rspec we require spec_helper and spec_helper.rb  in its turn requires app.rb and also data_mapper_setup.rb (only now while writing this post I realised I can do that instead of requiring data_mapper_setup from each test!);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in addition we require sinatra in app.rb, data mapper in data_mapper_setup, capybara and database cleaner in spec_helper.spec.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All clear and very logical, right? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition we had a very nice adventure to deploy our little bookmark manager program to heroku!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heroku is super cool and simple, but when you use it for the first time and your program needs a database... it might be not so straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here we had to learn the importance of environment in Sinatra. By pure coincidence I read "Jump start Sinatra" in a tube in the morning, and there was a little chapter called 'Environments'. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, "... there are three predefined environments: development, production(when your app is live on the server), and test... To check what environment the app is running in, the helper methods &lt;code&gt;production?&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;development?&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;test?&lt;/code&gt; will return &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;..."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used this couple of times in Gemfile, like this:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;group :test do  
  gem 'rspec'
  gem 'capybara'
end  
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I never paid attention. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What it actually means, is that depending on environment particular gems will or will not be used. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when you use database it means, that depending on environment, path to a database will be different (when on local, database will be on your computer, when online using heroku database should be on ... heroku! Obvious, right?). So, we need to tell heroku to create database first, and in data_mapper_setup.rb we needed to indicate a path to a database depending on environment in which our program is running!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our case:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for test environment we used database postgres://localhost/bookmark_manager_test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for development environment we used database postgres://localhost/bookmark_manager_development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and for production environment in heroku it is &lt;code&gt;ENV['DATABASE_URL']&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To copy your database to heroku you do &lt;code&gt;heroku run console&lt;/code&gt; and...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I am not sure, will check it tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href="https://serene-scrubland-3780.herokuapp.com/"&gt;this is&lt;/a&gt; what we have so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not much, but I am soooooooo proud!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Day 21</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The topic of this week is Databases. &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managed to write a very simple version of "rock, paper, scissors" in under couple of hours!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then was refactoring it for 2 days. And playing for... 5 minutes. Very satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great weekend anyway. 2 parties + 2 theatre evenings in 2 days! Seems that challenge was not so challenging&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://localhost:2368/days-19-20/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">e51f7179-1e5b-4781-8c51-73e1924bcf75</guid><dc:creator>Yana Proskurina</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 20 Sep 2015 20:10:03 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Weeeeekeeeeeeend!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how a client (browser) communicates with server using request/response mechanism,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what server does when it receives request(in very simple words, request first gets to a particular port, then goes through security procedures, than middleware translates it from a string&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description><link>http://localhost:2368/days-16-18-gone-online/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">fe51bdc6-d306-4ce8-8caa-a58a85d1698c</guid><dc:creator>Yana Proskurina</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 18 Sep 2015 20:08:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I learned a lot of new stuff this week:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how a client (browser) communicates with server using request/response mechanism,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what server does when it receives request(in very simple words, request first gets to a particular port, then goes through security procedures, than middleware translates it from a string to ruby(in our case), then controller replies (with the help of model and views), and the response goes all the way back to the client(browser),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how a program works when a request received (first finds a requested method and a path in a controller, from there to a model(program logic) if needed, and then to views folder (where templates are, we use erb to write them), then you can see the result on your page. But if the result is a form, after you fill in the form and press a button, then the form probably will redirect you to a post method with a particular path, and from there probably to another get method, that will send you to another template in views, and then you will see the result on the screen),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how params hash and session hash work in Sinatra, how session is connected with cookies, and how you can make a multiplayer game using global variable (though it is not the best way to do it),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to write tests in Capybara and how to force yourself to do it...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is important to keep your program simple and readable! Seems impossible, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result of the week: I can play my own battleships game with a computer. And sometimes I can even win. But I am not sure that anyone except a computer and myself would be able to read this code ever... &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
