&lt;p&gt;And there are 3 simple steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Red - making your test fail&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Green - writing a piece of code to make your test pass&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refactor - cleaning up you mess (making your code look nicer AND work)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple enough process but quite powerful!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research: DONE!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Day 2</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Standups (our morning and afternoon meetings) are when you are actually standing up!

It makes meetings shorter. And surprisingly more efficient. If only all meetings in business were like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pair programming violently ruins stereotypes about programmers, siting along at home and coding. Programmers communicate more then anyone from the outside world could ever imagine! And it seems like a very good idea. I had a wonderful pair programming partner today, very positive and committed. It helps a lot to have someone to discuss stuff and it is generally more fun. We did a good part of legendary Boris Bike exercise today. Should finish it by the end of the week.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RSpec is ... well … unusual.  First you write a test, make it fail (I never thought failures could be so exiting!) and only then write code and test it.  But it is super important. &lt;br&gt;
In consulting, people say that you can find 70% of an answer in a question,  but here you can find 70% of your code in tests and errors. Tests seem to be something like a skeleton of the code, that does not let the code fall apart. If you change something in one part of the code, tests immediately inform you if this change ruined something in another part of the code. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meditation. The second best thing after sleeping! Love it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I am still fighting for my social life, I went to Ronnie Scott to see Monty Alexander trio today. They were amazing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And more about social life –  my partner tried to buy tickets to Dismaland today. Could someone write a good code for Banksy to manage a queue on the day when tickets go on sale?! It is such an awful mess! Grrrrr...&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Day 1 - Induction</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Today was the first day in a month with NO CODING!

&lt;p&gt;But anyway the day was very intense and productive. &lt;/p&gt;

Surprise!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But anyway the day was very intense and productive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the day I had plenty of opportunities to chat with people from our cohort and the conclusion is... Our cohort is awesome! I have not seen so many positive open smart beautiful and different people in one room for a long time.  Harry from Cornwall, Philip from Gloucestershire, Michael from North York, Lucy from Melbourne, Matt from Cheshire and all 30+ of us from all over the world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thinking about the induction itself, well, the main words are: very professional, clever and thoughtful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New words learned: CJO (I wish every company had this position!), educational psychology (!), slackoverflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had some Northern Line madness in the end, got home in 2.5 hours. I do not think I will ever leave Makers before 8 pm again!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Pre-course</title><description>&lt;p&gt;So, I joined the Makers Academy September cohort. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We start on September 1st, but before that we have to finish the Pre-course. We are well equipped with several tools to go through the pre-course: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MA lessons, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slack (where we can help each other) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and Google (where strangers can help us)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description><link>http://localhost:2368/pre-course/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">12ef853f-5e4e-4efb-aa8b-43ecaffa7460</guid><dc:creator>Yana Proskurina</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 31 Aug 2015 15:14:09 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;So, I joined the Makers Academy September cohort. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We start on September 1st, but before that we have to finish the Pre-course. We are well equipped with several tools to go through the pre-course: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MA lessons, &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h6 id="week1commandline"&gt;Week 1: Command line&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Command line interface (CLI) allows you to communicate directly with your computer, with underlying code of your computer, to be precise. You do not need support of graphical user interface (GUI) to create new files and folders, move between the folders and see what's inside, change access to files, to find stuff, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing GUI to CLI feels a bit like removing training wheels form a bicycle. At first it is uncomfortable but later you appreciate the freedom you get. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maker's lesson on CL is very informative and clear, very easy to read and understand even for a newbie (like myself!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New words learned: &lt;code&gt;pwd, ls, cd, mkdir, rmdir, rm, touch, cp, mv&lt;/code&gt; (renaming a file is actually moving a file!), &lt;code&gt;cat, less, chmod, man, find, grep, sudo, shebang&lt;/code&gt; and many many others. Also learned how to use | &amp;lt; &gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; to redirect streams. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So with all these knowledge and trembling hands I successfully finished the first pre-course challenge. Only 3 weeks later I can say that it was just a kid's stuff...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id="week2gitandgithub"&gt;Week 2: Git and Github&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Week 2 started on Friday! I had a trip planned for the whole week 2, so had to finish my learnings for the week before it even has started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning git is like receiving an access to a new universe. Because Github is a new universe! Populated with developers only. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Git is a version control system. And you cannot overrate the importance of using it. It helps you to save you work on different stages, to work on different versions of a program, to work on a project with a team, etc. You have to develop a habit to use it but it pays off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best thing is GitHub! It is like a huge open library of source code. You can keep your code there, but you can also browse through other developers code, fork it, clone it, even improve it (well, I am soooooo far from that now).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a developer you are your Github profile. Feeling exposed! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id="weeks3ruby"&gt;Weeks 3: Ruby&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the beginning I thought that making mistakes and asking for help could be the most difficult things for me on this course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Makers are so good in helping you to ask for help! &lt;br&gt;
There is Slack, where you can communicate with your cohort and seniors, there are Github issues, where you can ask questions, and on week 3 of pre-course you get a mentor! No way you are left on your own!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you start learning actual programming language you need help more and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruby is a very popular programming language and a very elegant one! The more you learn it the more you appreciate how smart it is. My vocabulary expanded dramatically with words like &lt;code&gt;object, class, method, variable, string, array, hash&lt;/code&gt; and tonns and tonns of method names...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I finished Chris Pine book, finished sections 1 and 2 of Ruby Kickstart, and (the most exciting) started to play on codewars!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Codewars are addictive. I have an awful mess at home, barely walk with my dog, and my partner is getting used to this absent look, when I pretend to participate in a conversation but actually can not stop thinking about an unresolved kata... you know...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point I forced myself to stick to 7 and 8 kyu kata, to learn how to write more elegant 'ruby style' code. Solving a problem is one thing but solving it with a nice code is so much more satisfying! My favourite trick now is to write &lt;code&gt;if...else..end&lt;/code&gt; sentence in one line with &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;condition&amp;gt; ? &amp;lt;if true&amp;gt; : &amp;lt;if false&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. It makes a code look much lighter!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this week's challenge to reach 70 points on codewars was more fun then challenge! &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/"&gt;Stackoverflow&lt;/a&gt; helps a lot, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this week I also had my first session of pair programming with my tutor. Loved it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh! And I also learned to use some Markdown to make my page look nicer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id="week4moreruby"&gt;Week 4: More Ruby&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I was in Edinburgh for Fringe festival! Watched tonnes of great shows! And I must say that technology is everywhere, even in the &lt;a href="https://english.komische-oper-berlin.de/schedule/magic-flute/"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt;! And of course in &lt;a href="http://lacaserne.net/index2.php/theatre/eight_eight_seven/"&gt;theatre&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My learning this week was between the shows, but 4 hour train to Edinburgh and back helped a lot. I covered most part of the Well-Grounded Rubyist by David A. Black. The book is so good! A real page-turner. It is also very smart for the publisher to give you a free ebook (password protected) when you buy a hardcopy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also I did some more katas and started reading about rspec.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I spent my last day before the course writing this post! The fun begins in 15 hours!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Hello, world</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I can't believe it is happening :)&lt;/p&gt;
