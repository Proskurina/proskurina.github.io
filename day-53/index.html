            <p>Today Evgeniy (Makers founder and CEO) gave a great talk on Teal companies.</p>

<p>The talk was based on Frédéric Laloux book Reinventing Organizations.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this book the author uses a colour scheme to describe the historical development of human organizations: Red &gt; Orange &gt; Green &gt; Teal. </p>
  
  <p>Laloux lists three breakthroughs of Teal organizations:</p>
  
  <p>Self-management: driven by peer relationships</p>
  
  <p>Wholeness: involving the whole person at work</p>
  
  <p>Evolutionary purpose: let the organization adapt and grow, not be driven</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In simple words Teal companies are based on trust, responsible and proactive approach to work. No one tells you what to do and you do things only if you believe that these things are worth doing. And at work you are the same person as in "real" life, because work IS your real life and you do not have to pretend to be someone else. So the main idea is to work and enjoy life at the same time.</p>

<p>Sounds like a dream! But it is real.</p>

<p>It seems that Makers Academy is fantastic not only for students but also for people who work there.</p>
