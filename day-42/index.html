            <p>In the morning we met our juniors for the first time! <br>
Only 6 weeks ago we were on their place. 6 weeks! Like the whole life! And a good one!</p>

<p>Now we have new coaches, they are very cool, but I will miss our old ones, they were geniuses. </p>

<p>This week we are going learn Ruby on rails. It is not that we really can learn it in a week, but as always we will give it a try and do our best.</p>

<p><img src="http://rewalls.com/pic/201111/1024x600/reWalls.com-52370.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Now the only thing I can say about it is MAGIC! It knows everything. Do not try to do anything your way, Ruby on rails knows better! I think it is the centrepiece of our course. So, the week should be very interesting (as if we've ever had a not interesting one).</p>

<p>And in the evening I went to Dee Dee Bridgewater concert! She was fantastic!  I must admit that the course intensity is tough but bearable, it is my social life intensity that is killing me.</p>
