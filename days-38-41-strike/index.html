            <p>The end of the week and weekend I spent working mostly on our bowling challenge.</p>

<p>It seemed ok in the beginning, code looked nice, then became heavier, then unreadable and then... I followed one of our coaches advice: "It is always fun to throw everything away and  start from the beginning". </p>

<p>I had another idea on how to build it. The task became ok again, I wrote a nice engine, it all worked so nicely, that I decided to make an interface. That was not wise. I stopped sleeping at nights. I even came back to the first version of the code, but it made things even worse. I went to a long long walk to a park. And the next day again.</p>

<p>And then suddenly I had a solution. And it worked! And it involved only reasonable amount of code! And I even had some time to write this post!</p>

<p>But the lesson was learned - if you need an interface, think about it from the beginning. </p>
