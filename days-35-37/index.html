<p>New knowledge for the last 3 days in few words:</p>

<p>MEAN stays for Mongo, Express, Angular and Node.</p>

<p>Node helps you to run your JS program using terminal, just print <code>node &lt;filename.js&gt;</code> in command line. If you type <code>node</code> in terminal you can play with JS the same way as you play with Ruby using <code>irb</code> (but I already got used to console and console.log()). It is not a server, but you can create one with it. And everything is in JS! So no need to switch from JS to Ruby (or another language) and back. An important thing about Node is that it is asynchronous, which makes it very effective. But you have to use callbacks for that, and it is not so straight forward in the beginning.</p>

<p>Express is something like Sinatra, but for Node JS. It seems easier and more intuitive, but may be it is because we already learned how to deal with Sinatra. For express template engine is not needed, it can handle html files directly, it is good for simple projects but for more complicated you can use Jade or ejs (they are like erb for ruby).</p>

<p>Mongo is a non SQL database, it stores information as JSON, and it seems a bit chaotic, but may be it is not, I just started to play with it.</p>

<p>And Angular... I am not sure yet. We will have the whole week dedicated to it, so I will write about it later.</p>
