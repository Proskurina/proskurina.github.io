<p>I had an excellent pair, he was so calm and nice, and SO attentive to details. I liked his way of learning very much, and from now on my motto is 'go slow!' It is important now to understand every little detail, it will help a lot later.</p>

<p>On Fridays we have a group lunch. Everybody come to a room with their lunches and discuss stuff with each other, nothing formal, no agenda, just one more opportunity to have a chat with someone from your cohort, or with a senior or a coach. I talked with several people and it is so interesting that we all share very similar story about our old life: good work, enough money, but no energy, awful mornings when you have to go to work (especially Monday of course), and the worst part of the week is Sunday evening... And then (dream)Makers appeared in our lives! </p>

<p>I plan to try to do this blog more technical starting from the next week.</p>

<p>But now it is Friday evening, and there is a free beer on the kitchen at the Makers! <br>
First week at Makers passed as 1 day. <br>
And it was a great day! <br>
Cheers!</p>
