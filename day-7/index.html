This week we are supposed to continue improving our skills in OOP (last week's task and weekend challenge were also about using OOP). </p>

<p>OOP is object oriented programming. As it comes from the title, object is the main thing here. Same as in real life. And as in real life objects can communicate with each other. <br>
To make an object first you need to make a class (it is like a blueprint, from which you can create objects). You can write a class, like this</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">class Dog

  attr_reader :name  

  def initialize (name)
    @name = name
  end

  def bark
    "Woof!"
  end

end  
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can make a real object from this class!</p>

<pre><code>my_dog = Dog.new('Shokky!')  
</code></pre>

<p>And use this object to do stuff:</p>

<pre><code>puts my_dog.name  
puts my_dog.bark
</code></pre>

<p>The result will be:</p>

<pre><code>Shokky!  
Woof!  
</code></pre>

<p>Easy, right?</p>

<p>So using this simple technic this week we are supposed to make Battle Ships game! And this time the instructions are minimal. We are working on our own!</p>

<p>Such a great field for creativity!</p>

<p>What classes should there be? how they should communicate with each other? who knows more - a ship or a board? do we need a board at all? are there any missiles involved? what are the rules? should we play this game first for an hour or so for the inspiration?  </p>

<p>Love it!</p>

<p>Oh! And also today was David's birthday! Happy birthday David! <br>
Harry arranged a cake and we sang a birthday song! That was great! Best moment of the day.</p>
