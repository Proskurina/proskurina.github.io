            <p>Today started with a research that you can see in my previous post, and somehow it took sooooo much time, that we were not able to start Battle Ships before lunch. </p>

<p>During lunchtime yesterday and today we had Lunch talks. One more great thing in the Makers!</p>

<p>Yesterday as a guest we had a Director of <a href="http://www.createeducation.co.uk/">CREATE Education Project</a>. He told us a lot of pretty amazing stuff about 3D printing and how <a href="https://ultimaker.com/">Ultimaker 3D Printers</a> can be used for education. </p>

<p>And today the founder of <a href="https://www.lexoo.co.uk/">Lexoo</a>, who also have a huge experience in development, gave us couple of advises on how to become a good developer (write no code!).</p>

<p>After the talk and meditation we came back to our main project.</p>

<p>And I am so proud of myself today, because:</p>

<ul>
<li>I managed to go slow, and go through each detail in MVP,</li>
<li>I managed to explain to my partner some very important things about testing,</li>
<li>We had a dramatic breakthrough in Battle Ships!!! </li>
</ul>

<p>What a happy day!</p>

<p>On the way home was thinking about my progress...</p>

<p>And then saw this!</p>

<p>Is it just me, or is there a clear connection here? <br>
I wonder what my result will be!</p>
