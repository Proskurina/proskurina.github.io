<p>Pair programming violently ruins stereotypes about programmers, siting along at home and coding. Programmers communicate more than anyone from the outside world could ever imagine! And it seems like a very good idea. I had a wonderful pair programming partner today, very positive and committed. It helps a lot to have someone to discuss stuff and it is generally more fun. We did a good part of legendary Boris Bike exercise today. Should finish it by the end of the week.   </p>

<p>RSpec is ... well … unusual.  First you write a test, make it fail (I never thought failures could be so exiting!) and only then write code and test it.  But it is super important. <br>
In consulting, people say that you can find 70% of an answer in a question,  but here you can find 70% of your code in tests and errors. Tests seem to be something like a skeleton of the code, that does not let the code fall apart. If you change something in one part of the code, tests immediately inform you if this change ruined something in another part of the code. </p>

<p>Meditation. The second best thing after sleeping! Love it!</p>

<p>As I am still fighting for my social life, I went to Ronnie Scott to see Monty Alexander trio today. They were amazing!</p>

<p>And more about social life –  my partner tried to buy tickets to Dismaland today. Could someone write a good code for Banksy to manage a queue on the day when tickets go on sale?! It is such an awful mess! Grrrrr...</p>
