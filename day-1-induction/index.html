            <p>Today was the first day in a month with NO CODING! Surprise!</p>

<p>But anyway the day was very intense and productive. </p>

<p>During the day I had plenty of opportunities to chat with people from our cohort and the conclusion is... Our cohort is awesome! I have not seen so many positive open smart beautiful and different people in one room for a long time.  Harry from Cornwall, Philip from Gloucestershire, Michael from North York, Lucy from Melbourne, Matt from Cheshire and all 30+ of us from all over the world. </p>

<p>And thinking about the induction itself, well, the main words are: very professional, clever and thoughtful. </p>

<p>New words learned: CJO (I wish every company had this position!), educational psychology (!), slackoverflow.</p>

<p>Had some Northern Line madness in the end, got home in 2.5 hours. I do not think I will ever leave Makers before 8 pm again!</p>
